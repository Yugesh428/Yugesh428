### 👋 Hello there, I'm Yugesh Bastola!

I'm an IT student at TechSpire,and full-time bug squasher. Currently walking the adventurous path of a **Full-Stack Developer** with a backend-first mindset. I break things with **Node.js**, fix them with **PostgreSQL** and **MSSQL**, and test my creations with **Postman** (sometimes even on purpose). On the frontend, I tame the chaos with **React**, **HTML**, **CSS**, and just enough **JavaScript** to stay dangerous.

⚡ My mission? To turn caffeine and curiosity into production-ready code.  
🎯 My goal? Someday engineer solutions at **Google** or **Microsoft** (big dreams need big brackets {}).
