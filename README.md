## 👋 Hi, I’m Yugesh Bastola —  
an IT student at TechSpire and a passionate bug fixer. I’m on a journey to become a confident Full-Stack Developer who starts from the backend and reaches all the way to the frontend.

I create strong, reliable backends using Node.js, PostgreSQL, and MSSQL. I like to test everything carefully with Postman — sometimes even breaking my own work just to make it better. On the frontend side, I build clean and user-friendly interfaces with React, HTML, CSS, and just enough JavaScript to keep things smooth.

Recently, I’ve been learning TypeScript and Next.js to write better code and build faster websites. I’m also diving into SEO optimization because making a website is not enough; it should be easy to find too.

⚡ I’m driven by curiosity, coffee, and the goal of turning ideas into real, working software.  
🎯 My dream is to grow, learn, and one day work at top tech companies like Google or Microsoft.

⚡ **My mission?**  
To turn caffeine and curiosity into production-ready code.  

🎯 **My goal?**  
Someday engineer solutions at **Google** or **Microsoft** (big dreams need big brackets {}).
